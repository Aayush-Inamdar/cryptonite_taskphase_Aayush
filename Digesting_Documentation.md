# Digesting Documentation
In this module I learned about getting help on how to use programs.
The first challenge was just all about giving the right arguement to the /challenge/challenge
> /challenge/challenge --giveflag

### --printfile
--printfie although itself an arguement requires a second arguement which is the path of the final output (flag)
> /challenge/challenge --printfile /challenge/run

### Searching manuals 
I did 
> man challenge
>
> / flag

This showed me the right arguement
### searching for manuals
I could not complete this challenge. The text of man man is way to big and / flag or / challenge gave no output
### helpful programs
I did
>/challenge/run --help

For the next one help is a program and not an arguement so..
> help challenge
