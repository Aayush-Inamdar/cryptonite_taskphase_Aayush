# Shell Variables
### Printing Variables
I substituted Flag for the variable

pwn.college{wOu8frFnv4z9dHEc1fSYaGJjTX-.ddTN1QDLzQDO0czW}
### Setting Variables
I did PWN=COLLEGE 

pwn.college{cH77jf4-lCAQv-MjnnFlp86n8h.dlTN1QDLzQDO0czW}
### Multi-word variables
I just did PWN="College Yeah"
### Exporting files
I exported PWN and set it to value COLLEGE...whereas i set the value of COLLEGE to PWN but did not export it

pwn.college{MigEOvsEJ_iihDqbvuHSMgiJGxv.dJjN1QDLzQDO0czW}
### Printing Exported Variables
I just used env command. A lot of text popped up. In that I looked for FLAG variable.

### Storing Command Output
I had to store output of /challenge/run to variable PWN. So I did PWN=$(challenge/run). After that all I had to do was print it out.

### Reading Input
I did read PWN put in COLLEGE and got the flag.

pwn.college{MU_jf66hlwveMTvW90BpHP-ey33.dhzN1QDLzQDO0czW}
### Reading Files
Variables can be assigned the value of output of a command. So i directly assigned value of challenge/run to variable PWN. Then I did echo $PWN which gave me the flag.
