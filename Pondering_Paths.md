# Pondering Paths
In this module I learned about directories and paths. I learned what are the various ways to access these directories and paths
### The Root & Program and absolute paths
All directories originally begin with a / . Paths leading to such directories are called 'absolute paths'

for example
> /tmp
### Position thy self, Position elsewhere, Position yet elsewhere.
In this I learned about working directories and how i can use 'cd' to change my working directory
### implicit relative paths, from / , explicit relative paths, from / 
Anything that comes after a / is called a relative path. "." can be used instead of writing home directory over and over.
### home sweet home
every user ha a /home/user directory which can be shortened by using "~"
